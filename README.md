## Project Description

Our project will revolve around building an interactive dashboard that will allows users to enter the symbol for any stock or crpyto asset. It will then analyze that asset using a variety of metrics, such as an RSI indicator, bollinger bands, public sentiment analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and various price history charts. 

The dashboard will then provide the user with a recommendation of:
1. "Buy!"
2. "Not sure?"
3. "Are you crazy!? Don't buy!"

Therefore, the research question our project will attempt to answer is if you should be any given stock or crpyto asset. 

## Datasets to be used
We will be using a variety of APIs to collect our data.

| API Name | Data collected |
| ------ | ------ |
| Alpaca | Historical stock data |
| Crypto API tbd | Historical crypto data |
| Alpha Vantaga | Realtime and Historial Stock Data |
| Twitter | Public sentiment data |
| Reddit | Public sentiment data |

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. Create a skeleton plan for Project 1. 
2. Begin data importing process.
3. Explore and clean up data.
4. Start the coding process for each individual metric.
5. Create an outline for the dashboard setup, including location of panels and tabs.
6. Build the algorithm to determine if a stock should be a buy or wait.
7. Deploy the dashboard to the web.
